# WikiMudas

WikiMudas is a wiki-like app to collect data on bird molt biology. It is designed so that all species wiki pages have the same information and that the information is standardized. It also stores all the information for later approval by an administrator.

Currently the database is being built, with tests to get it with the best structure possible.
